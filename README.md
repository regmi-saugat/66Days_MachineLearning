  **💡 Logistic Regression:**
  - Logistic Regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is binary. It is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary varible and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level varaibles.
  - Binary or Binomial Logistic Regression can be understood as the type of Logistic Regression that deals with scenarios wherein the observed outcomes for dependent variables can be only in binary, i.e., it can have only two possible types.
  - Multinomial Logistic Regression works in scenarios where the outcome can have more than two possible types – type A vs type B vs type C – that are not in any particular order.
