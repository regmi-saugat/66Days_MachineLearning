  **💡 Logistic Regression:**
  - Logistic Regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is binary. It is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary varible and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level varaibles.
  - Binary or Binomial Logistic Regression can be understood as the type of Logistic Regression that deals with scenarios wherein the observed outcomes for dependent variables can be only in binary, i.e., it can have only two possible types.
  - Multinomial Logistic Regression works in scenarios where the outcome can have more than two possible types – type A vs type B vs type C – that are not in any particular order.

  **💡 Gradient Descent:**
    - It is an algorithm to find the minimum of a convex function.  It is used in algorithm, for example, in linear regression.
Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that is popular and it is a base for many other optimization techniques, which tries to obtain minimal loss in a model by tuning the weights/parameters in the objective function.
    
      There are threee types of Gradient Descent:
            i. Batch Gradient Descent
            ii. Stochastic Gradient Descent
            iii. Mini Batch Gradient Descent
            
       Steps to achieve minimal loss:
            1. Decide your cost function.
            2. Choose random initial values for parameters θ, 
            3. Find derivative of your cost function, 
            4. Choosing appropriate learning rate, 
            5. Update your parameters till you converge. This is where, you have found optimal θ values where your cost function, is minimum.
